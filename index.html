                <p>Derek Price is a PhD candidate at Vanderbilt University in German and Media Studies. During the 2018/2019 academic year, he was a Fulbright Research grantee associated with Universität zu Köln, where he worked on his dissertation "Machines with a Soul of Their Own: Simulator Games between Art, Industry, and Player Practices." His project investigates how and why "simulator games" about industrial work became popular leisure-time commodities in Germany, as well as the role that German players, developers, and publishers played in this unique genre. Derek is also the creator and co-host of "<a class="email" href="http://scholarsatplay.net" target="_blank">Scholars At Play</a>," a podcast dedicated to the critical discussion of games in society and the academy.</p>
