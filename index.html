                <p>Derek Price is a Mellon Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Vanderbilt Center for Digital Humanities. He holds a joint-PhD in German Studies and Comparative Media Analysis from Vanderbilt University. His dissertation, titled "The Work of Nonfiction: Simulator Games in Germany" investigates how a genre of simulation computer games about industrial machines and work became popular in and beyond Germany. Additionally, Derek has published articles on and organized conferences, workshops, and seminars about the intersections between games and literature, history, pedagogy, ecocriticism, surveillance, race, sexuality, and political organizing. He has received numerous grants in support of his research, including a Fulbright Research grant for the 2018/2019 academic year, which he carried out at the Universität zu Köln.</p>
				<p>As an instructor, Derek has taught courses on German language and literature, film and media, European history and culture, and online teaching, and has developed a course on games and play in Germany, as well as a course on digital media and methods based on his training in Media Studies and Digital Humanities. Derek is also the creator and co-host of "<a class="email" href="http://scholarsatplay.net" target="_blank">Scholars At Play</a>," a podcast dedicated to the critical discussion of games in society and the academy.</p>
