                <p>Derek Price is a PhD candidate at Vanderbilt University in German Studies and Comparative Media Analysis and Practice. Originally from Pennsylvania, he earned a B.A. in Philosophy from Belmont University in 2012 and taught English in Germany before beginning graduate studies at Vanderbilt in 2014. Derek's approach to research is comparative and interdisciplinary, focusing on the intersections between new media aesthetics and cultural studies. His dissertation "Machines with a Soul of Their Own: Simulator Games in Germany" investigates how a genre of computer games about industrial machines and work became popular in and beyond Germany. He has received numerous grants in support of his research, including a Fulbright Research grant for the 2018/2019 academic year, which he carried out at the Universität zu Köln.</p>
				<p>As an instructor, Derek has taught courses on German language and literature, film and media, European history and culture, and online teaching, and has developed a course on games and play in Germany, as well as a course on digital media and methods based on his training in Media Studies and Digital Humanities. He has published articles on and organized conferences, workshops, and seminars about the intersections between games and literature, history, pedagogy, ecocriticism, surveillance, race, sexuality, and political organizing. Derek is also the creator and co-host of "<a class="email" href="http://scholarsatplay.net" target="_blank">Scholars At Play</a>," a podcast dedicated to the critical discussion of games in society and the academy.</p>
